## Description
This is a guessing game with a Guardians of the Galaxy theme.  The player must attempt to guess the mystery number, between numbers one and one-hundred.  The game will provide feedback based on the guess, allowing the player to refine their next attempt.  This project was first built using 'vanilla' javascript and later was converted to React to increase my knowledge of the React.js framework and utilizing component state.
